# Factory Method

**Factory Method:** this project explores the implementation of the Factory
Method design pattern. It demonstrates how to use this pattern to create objects
while providing flexibility in choosing their types. The Factory Method pattern
is a creational pattern that separates object creation from their usage,
allowing for easy extensibility and maintenance of code.

## Features
 - Implementation of the Factory Method design pattern in Python.
 - Provides a clear separation between object creation and their usage.
 - Supports the creation of various types of objects with minimal
   code changes.
 - Promotes code reusability and maintainability.
 
 ## Objectives
 The primary objectives of this project are:
 - To illustrate the application of the Factory Method pattern
   in Python.
 - To showcase the benefits of using this design pattern, such as flexibility
   and ease of extending the codebase.
 - To provide a practical example for educational purposes.

## Dependencies
